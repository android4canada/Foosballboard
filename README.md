# Foosballboard
This project is to track foosball scores for TMG

-You can view rankings by Wins or by Games Played

-To add a new game score, click on the + button

-To delete a record, swipe to the left (Maybe I should add confirmation in the future)

-To edit a record, click and hold on an entry (long click)

A feature  I would add if this is deployed to production, would be crash reporting such as HockeySdk and Unit Testing for improved quality in future
